    "In the below project we will explore the power of python on financial analysis. Python is a terrific tool for analyses of any type, and financial analysis is no exception. Using only code, we will analyze and plot the returns of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and compare those returns to the broader market as approximated by the S&P 500. We will also calculate 2 common measures of risk and volatility - Beta and the Sharpe Ratio, both of which are commonly used by financial analysts when evaluating a stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will approximate the performance of the S&P 500 using the SPDR S&P 500 ETF which has ticker \"SPY\". This is a commonly used benchmark in real world financial analysis.\n",

    "On top of it all we will design our code to be reproducible so that once complete, we can load in different data that has a similar format and produce the same results for that new data!"

    "Interesting. It looks like our hypothesis for TSLA holds true. TSLA has a higher beta than AMZN and SPY (beta of 1.0), which we expected from our daily returns chart. This indicates that the stock is more volatile and potentially riskier than AMZN and SPY. AMZN on the other hand appears to be less volatile than the market based on the 5 year beta, but in our daily returns plot it seemed more volatile? Why would this be? Look back up at our original plots of price for AMZN and SPY. Notice that SPY had a huge dip in early 2020, but AMZN had only a little dip (the dip was due to the market's reaction to COVID-19)? Well this dip in SPY drastically increased SPY's variance, thus driving down beta for both TSLA and AMZN. You can check this yourself by doing the same calculation for the 5 years leading up February 2020. The beta's for TSLA and AMZN should both be well over 1.0.\n",

    "What a beta < 1.0 for AMZN could indicate is that in normal market conditions AMZN's price moved around more than the market, but in the face of the COVID-19 volatility, AMZN was actually less volatile than the rest of the market."
